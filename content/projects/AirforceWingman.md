A project I took over at Flight School, I was asked to dive into the existing code and add functionality to a flight sim to shoot targets. The end score also had to reflect the targets shot as well as register back onto the user's RFID wristband. Airforce Wingman was one of many games in an enterprise of convention apps aimed towards recruitment.

This competitive candy collecting catastrophe was a 2 week game jam where I live streamed every part of my development process on Twitch. Everything was made by me with the exception of the character art made by some friends of mine. The game was (unsuccessfully) submitted to the Chicaghoul 2024 Game jam.

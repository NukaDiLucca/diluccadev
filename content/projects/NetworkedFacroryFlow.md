This project tied in very closely with the V-22 factory project, however the difference for this was that the goal was mostly sales-motivated. This application was in the final V-22 factory 3D design we had put together a few months prior, with the added bells and whistles of being able to see and interact with other people in the space and view various aircraft fly into the factory.

COVID Cluster was my interview submission to Flight School Studio. The ask was to make a game in 2 days with the theme of "Asteroid". I took this time to make a game that would work with controller and keyboard and included a power-up system from a shop accessible between rounds. This game was supprisingly very fun to play and make, I'm happy to have had the opportunity to make and submit this project.

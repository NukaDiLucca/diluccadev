A project I was very proud of, I worked on a team with [Discovery Education](https://www.discoveryeducation.com/), producer Sheevangi Pathak, and developer Matthew Bodner. Together we created an experience of what it would feel to be on the Martian surface. The experience lasted about 10 minutes and allowed kids to be able to repair and program the Curiosity rover, grow a planet in a secure habitat, and discover interesting facts in a virtual interactive museum.

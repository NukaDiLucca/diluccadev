My senior year at Drexel I gathered 12 students to come together and take on the large endeavor of making a VR game in Unreal Engine 4. Under the guidance of [Jeff Salvage](https://jeffsalvage.com/) and [Paul Diefenbach](https://drexel.edu/westphal/about/directory/DiefenbachPaul/), over the next year we would go on to make a scalable VR-Handball game with unique mechanics. My role specifically was to program the UI and AI opponent as well as lead the team as a producer and Scrum master.

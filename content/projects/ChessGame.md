A simple chess game following all the rules programmed and designed to run via network. My role was to program some of the pieces logic, the "available moves" highlighting, the UI components, and writing test cases for all my work as well as the networked components. The focus on this project was primarily everything that goes on around a project (Test cases, documenttion, diagrams, documentation, etc.).

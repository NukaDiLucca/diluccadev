A second project with [Discovery Education](https://www.discoveryeducation.com/), producer Sheevangi Pathak, and developer Matthew Bodner. This experience allowed kids and adults alike to experience a narrated tour to the depths of the ocean and the vast life that inhabits it. From near the surface to the surprising depths whales are capable of reaching all to discover an underwater volcano.

In a class where we were asked to make a new game every 2 weeks based around a theme, I worked solo to make a small rpg game devoted to my friends. I really wanted to make a character controller that worked very similar to pokemon, however I wanted to design a unique dialogue system. Simply put, I made a game staring my friends, it is very reminiscent of our late D&D games gourging on chinese food.

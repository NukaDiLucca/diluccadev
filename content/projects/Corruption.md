Project 1 in a class where we were asked to make a new game every 2 weeks based around a theme. In corruption, you aim to gather as many coins as you can, however there are enemies seeking to do the same. The catch is the more money they get the faster and harder they hit. All you can do on the other hand is run, jump, and keep trying to make ends meet as the rich get richer.

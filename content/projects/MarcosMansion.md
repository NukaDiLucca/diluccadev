This project was a submission for the Adventure Game Jam. A 2 week project to make a game from scratch. My role for this was the project lead to bring a group of 8 developers together for a single 2 weeks project. We were not able to finish all the way through, however the endevour of it was very much worth the adventure. The game's sound track is included in the link, I implore you to listen, I always loved Andrews work.

My first assignement at Flight School Studio was to take a VR experience and convert it into a 360 video at 60fps. I worked solo on this project to take an experience that was originally developed for multiple VR platforms and transform it into a video. After stripping away vital controller interactions, I then used Nvidia Ansel to record the experience frame-by-frame.

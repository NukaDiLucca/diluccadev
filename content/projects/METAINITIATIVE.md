Meta Initiative was a passion project that lasted about 3 years. We were a technologically-focused tabletop group (~14 people strong) branching out of the esports organization, [Obey Alliance](https://www.obeyalliance.com/), to bring a larger influence of tech to the ttrpg space. We worked together with some amazing people in the space. I would run weekly one-shots, run online production for Live Plays, and help community members in the discord with their own campaigns.

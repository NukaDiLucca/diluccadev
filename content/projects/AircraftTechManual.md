One day I was approached by a tall lanky fellow with the ambitious idea of putting an entire Aircraft Technical Manual into a Hololens headset. The idea was to outfit every single sold unit of aircraft with an included Hololens in the event that something went wrong or some maintenance was needed. We would take a 3D scan of the aircraft and from there the application would run the user through a step-by-step process based on parsed information from the original tech manual.

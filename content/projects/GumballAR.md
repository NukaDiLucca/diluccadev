I made an AR filter to release publically alongside a mural made in down town Sugarland, Texas. The mural was essentailly an image target for an animation I made in maya. The turnaround and developemnt time was quick considering I've used SparkAR before. A metal plaque next to the large mural allows people to scan a QR code to download the filter.

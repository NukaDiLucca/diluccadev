A spontanious project where I worked with 40 of the Philadelphia Boeing branch's leadership to win a $2 billion bid to mod V-22 Osprey. over the course of a week, everyone split into groups to come up with their own plans on how to handle V-22's flying into the Philadelphia site. My role was to take all their ideas and make a vitrual representation that would allow anyone to traverse the factory and move it around. This was one of the wildest projects I've ever worked on.

A co-op sci-fi horror game where players board abandoned space stations to sever dimensional gateways that have allowed horrifying threats to populate the realm.

Worked with 10 other industry professionals as both a designer and programmer on this project to make various systems (AI, Missions, Pre/Post-Game Lobby, Audio Tie-in, Player Death)

I had to be extremely flexible with this project, doing so allowed me to touch every file to the point where I was well informed for any bug fixes or feature requests.

One of the first games to release with both Nanite and Lumen enabled.

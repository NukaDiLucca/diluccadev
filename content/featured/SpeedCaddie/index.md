A game created for the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am featuring pro golfer Jordan Spieth.

This experience was incredibly fun to develop, from driving mechanics, to course design, all the way down to the leaderboard side-app.

As a team, we were trusted heavily to make something fun while simultaneously representing the AT&T brand.

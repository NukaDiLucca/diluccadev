A virtual pong-like interactive installation made for the 2022 US Open in New York City.

I worked on a small team tasked with the goal of creating a fun competitive game for American Express. I was tasked with the development and programming of the game using Unity. The toughest aspect of this project was the seamless integration of the HTC Vive 3.0 Trackers in a large space with multiple setups.

I am proud of the work we had done, and would gladly take a project like this again in a heartbeat.

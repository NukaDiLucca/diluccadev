A mobile game aimed to launch the same time as it's [animated theatrical counterpart](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8337158/). This game served many purposes as well as an opportunity for me to try something very different from what I was used to.

With a small group of amazing artists and developers from around the world, we were able to make a fun story-based Match 3 experience.
